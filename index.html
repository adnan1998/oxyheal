              Diabetes is a chronic disorder where the human pancreas fails to
              regulate the sugar or glucose in the bloodstream effectively.
            </p>

            <p class="para para-2">
              Diabetes develops when the pancreas either does not generate
              enough insulin or stops producing altogether because the body
              becomes resistant to it.
            </p>
            <p class="para para-2">
              Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called
              glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar
              goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts
              like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use
              as energy.
            </p>
            <p class="para para-2">
              If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin
              or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there
              isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much
              blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause
              serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and
              kidney disease.

              India has a high prevalance of diabetes mellitus and the numbers
              are increasing at an alarming rate.
            </p>
            <p class="para para-2">
              India has a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and the numbers
              are increasing at an alarming rate. In India alone, diabetes is
              expected to increase from 40.6 million in 2006 to 79.4 million by
              2030. Studies have shown that the prevalence of diabetes in urban
              Indian adults is about 12.1%, the onset of which is about a decade
              earlier than their western counterparts and the prevalence of Type
              2 diabetes is 4-6 times higher in urban than in rural areas. The
              risk factors peculiar for developing diabetes among Indians
              include high familial aggregation, central obesity, insulin
              resistance and life style changes due to urbanization. Screening
              for gestational diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance among
              pregnant women provides a scope for primary prevention of the
              disease in mothers as well as in their children. The problems of
              obesity and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (important
              predisposing factors) are not confined to adults alone but
              children are also increasingly getting affected. Most long
              standing macro and micro vascular complications are also more
              common among Indian diabetics as compared to other races and
              ethnic groups. A strong familial clustering of diabetic
              nephropathy among Indian Type 2 diabetics has also been noted.
              Clustering of cardiovascular risk factor like Syndrome X is common
              among urban Indians. The rising incidence of diabetes and its
              complications are going to pose a grave health care burden on our
              country. Timely effective interventions/measures and screening
              tests for complications at the time of diagnosis becomes
              imperative not only for early detection, but also to prevent
              progression to end stage disease. Screening for gestational
              diabetes among pregnant women would also go a long way in primary
              prevention of the disease. Life style changes/interventions and
              drugs like rosiglitazone are the current strategies that can
              prevent and/or delay the onset of diabetes. Simple interventional
              strategies like "Eat less, Eat on time and Walk more" can go a
              long way in preventing these chronic disorders among present as
              well as in the future generations. <br><br>

              </p>
              <p class="para para-2">
                If you’re reading this, you’re already on the right track. Dealing with a problem becomes a lot easier if you understand the problem better, if you learn more about it. And when you learn about diabetes, you’ll understand how your body is affected by it and how you can help minimize its negative impact on your body. You’ll be in a much better position to make right choices with respect to your diet, medication and other day-to-day activities.
              </p>
              <p class="para para-2">
                For example, the wound of a diabetes patient takes a longer time to heal, which means one should be particularly careful about potential accidents and avoid putting ourselves to risks whenever possible.
              </p>
              <p class="para para-2">
                By learning more about diabetes, you can educate your peers, family, friends and relatives, thus enabling them to manage their diabetes better.
              </p>

                <h2>
                  Take Your Medication
                </h2>
              </p>
              <p class="para para-2">
                Often times we forget to take our medication even for a small cough or cold. However, you cannot have this casual approach when it comes to diabetes. Do not skip your diabetes medicines—take your tablets or insulin as prescribed by your doctor, and on time.
              </p>
              <p class="para para-2">
                <h2>Watch Your Diet</h2>
              </p>
              <p class="para para-2">
                Being careful about the food you consume is a good practice with or without practice. But, the consequences of not managing your diet become more severe when you have diabetes as some foods can directly impact your blood sugar levels. Hence, it’s imperative that one should maintain a strict diet plan in case of diabetes to nourish the body without causing any further damage to it.
              </p>
              <p class="para para-2">

              </p>
              <p class="para para-n">
                One of the best ways to keep your diabetes in control is through exercise. Physical activities or exercises reduce the level of glucose in your blood. Even simple exercises such as walking for at least 30 minutes every day can be extremely helpful. In addition to that, keep moving and stay active with activities such as gardening, yoga or even push-ups if you’re up for it. Staying active not only helps the body stay healthy but it also increases the immunity of the body, also aiding the treatment of diabetes.

                Approximately 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.¹ While obesity often contributes to the development of diabetes, the bigger driver of weight gain is the high insulin levels that are found well before the diagnosis of diabetes.There are some good reasons why the standard advice of “eat less, exercise more” doesn’t deliver results for people living with type 2 diabetes.
